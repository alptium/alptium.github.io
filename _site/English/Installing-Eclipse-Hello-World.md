## Starting "Hello world" in Eclipsе program 


**Which method prints in Јава program?** →System.out.println()


```
package helloworld;


public class Main {

	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```


1. **File** → **Save** → and a step to start program by clicking on **Run main**

Afterwards, in the Eclipse program in the field below the code that we have written, the program will print 'Hello World' as shown in the following picture:

*Note:* 

**System.out.println** → the method prints the line of text on the screen, in this case the text line is 'Hello World'

**;** → In Java, each command must end with this sign.


## Creating variables


Computer memory can be explained on the case of boxes. It consists of boxes that have their own names, and within each box there is some content:

In order to process the data, it is necessary to store them somehow. Storage is done in variables or variables that are defined in Java in the beginning. Therefore, most programming languages have multiple types of information that are entered into variables. We can split them into simple or primitive types and complex or complex types.

Examples of simple or primitive types are:

**Int** – **Intеger** = A variable type that prints whole numbers.

**Double** – **Double precision floating number** = A variable type that prints decimal numbers.

**Char** - **Character** = A variable type that prints a single character, sign, or symbol.

**Bool** – **Boolean** = A variable type that can have only two values, true or false, or rather True или False.

An example of a complex type is:

**String** - a complex complex type consisting of multiple characters.


**Example:** the task is to create a variable * type *intiger (int)* under the name **ab** that will contain a value of "14". The command to do this would look like this.

```
                int ab = 14;
		int lala = 150;
		int zebra = 234;
		int luk = 45;
```

**Example:** the task is to create a variable *character ( char )* under the name **jkl** that will contain a character  ‘a’.

```
                char jkl = 'a' ;
		char gh = '8' ;
		char sfgs = '$' ;
```
 
*Note:* characters are always recorded with the alleged characters **‘** → ’character’

**Example:** the task is to create a variable type *boolean (bool)* under the name **yt** that will contain a value True.
 
```
                boolean yt = true;
		boolean lop = false;
		boolean df = true;
```

*Note:* Boolean a type can only contain two values, either True or False.

**Example:** the task is to create a variable type *double* under the name **ujl** that will contain a decimal number 45,89.

```
                double ujl = 45.89;
		double er = 786579.982;
		double vb = 0.06864;
``` 

*Note:* decimal numbers are separated by a dot in Java instead of a comma.


So far, these have been examples of simple types. The next type is complex, it consists of more than one character.

**Example** complex type of variable *String*  under the name **jds** which contains characters “Marija Marjanovic”

```
                String jds = "Marija Marjanovic";
		String ywe = "Ulica 5, Beograd";
		String ulo = "Fly to the moon";
``` 

*Note:* the content of this type is always written with double allegations **“**.
