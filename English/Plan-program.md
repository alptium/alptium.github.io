#JAVA PROGRAMMING COURSE PLAN AND PROGRAM 

## MONTHLY PLAN

### FEBRUARY: 


1. **PROJECT PLAN** - is something that the Project Manager does.

Write a project plan from beginning to end as it's done at work.

Brief description of the project and description of the phases.

*Task:* Read Phases of Software Development Project SDLC

*Investigate on the Internet:* Softer development life cycle 

2. **REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS** - is something that the Busines Analyst does. 

Project analysis - who is the client?

Analysis of software functions - what is the main process or processes, what type of data are being entered?

3. **UI Mockups** - is something that the Busines Analyst does.

Draw pictures in which we describe screens in the program and what the user will 'click' - this all relates to the functional side of the project.

4. **ARCHITECTURE** - Architect

It refers to the system structure as far as the technical side is concerned.

This is something we are investigating ourselves.

*Task:* Read Software Architecture

*Investigate on the Internet:* Software Architecture Layers

Three layer architecture - short

	1. Presentation layer - refers to the appearance, display layer, what is visible to the user
	
	2. Logic layer - application logic-coordinates with the application, processes some commands, or calculates ..
	
Examples: a sports club chooses a new member (based on speed, height), average rating ..
	
	3. Data layer - data on trainers, athletes, doctors, patients, scheduled appointments, diagnosis ...
	

5. **UML** - Architect

*Task:* Read UML, UML diagram

Analyze images with a display of where the technical is.

Make UML diagram.

6. **BEGIN PROGRAMMING** 


### МАRCH, АPRIL, МАY 


1. **PROGRAMMING** 

We're doing code writing, but not just in Java. 

Logic layer - we're doing in Java =====> BACKEND DEVELOPER

Presentation layer - this is done in HTML, CSS, JavaScript ======> FRONTEND DEVELOPER

Date base layer - this is done in SQL =====> BACKEND DEVELOPER

Suggestion - Start with the most important elements

1. Start with what is most simple - enter data eg. patient information, doctor

2. Then start with the predictive function - for example, the program itself finds, for example, a diagnosis

2. **TESTING** - testing

 Quality Asurance QA


### JUNE 


1. Testing + Last Fixes

2. Presentation - Demo (slideshow) of our aplication + Short description

Making presentation to the client + delivery of software



RESULT OF THIS WORK - Possibilities


1. Job application - job interview.

**Result** 

Git Hub:

-Source code - what we programmed.

-Demo (slideshow) -  presentation of our program.

-Link to your profile - 


**CV**

Project XZY -  Git Hub link


## The course of the project development. 

 - Repository per project
 
Each project should have (except individual): 
 
	1. Project lead - technical

-Responsabilities: creating tickets in Git Hub, planning and assigning work + architecture/ development	
	
	2. Developers

-Responsabilities: development and testing
	
	3. Mentor > Валентина Цупаћ -

-providing additional ideas, coding review, additional help (suggestions for reading)
