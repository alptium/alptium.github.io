**How to make a new project ?**

We will create a simple program that will show us on the screen „Hello World!”

Click on **File** -> choose **New**, then click on -> **Java project**

After this command, a window will appear in which the name of the new project is entered (in these case ‘Test project 2’ ) and -> Finish

In the Eclipse program, the folder that we created with the name we selected for the project is displayed.

Next step is :

Double click on **TestProject2**  when new fields are opened in the folder.

Note: **‘src’**-source represents a file within a program for storing program codes. 

Right click on **‘src’** -> **New** -> **Class**

After this step, a window that we name **‘Main’** is opened and we mark the box under the name **‘public static void main’**

At this point, the program has generated the assigned commands and applied them to the initial (work) page of the Eclipse program.

Note: 

**public class** = every file in Јava program is marked with ‘class’ , which means that each line of the running code should be within the ( ‘class’) class. In this case, we named the 'class' as Main
 
**public static void main (String[] args)** -> This tells the program that this is the first method that the program will execute. The program is a list of instructions that we want to execute.

In Java, each application has a starting point (input point), which is a method that is designated as 'main'. This means that each Java program starts with the main method.
**public:** свако може приступити
	
**static:** ово ако можеш ти објаснити шта означава
	
**void:** ово ако можеш ти објаснити шта означава
	
**main:** име методе
