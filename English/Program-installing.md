**How to make a new project ?**

We will create a simple program that will show us on the screen „Hello World!”

Click on **File** -> choose **New**, then click on -> **Java project**

After this command, a window will appear in which the name of the new project is entered (in these case ‘Test project 2’ ) and -> Finish

In the Eclipse program, the folder that we created with the name we selected for the project is displayed.

Next step is :

Double click on **TestProject2**  when new fields are opened in the folder.

Note: **‘src’**-source represents a file within a program for storing program codes. 

Right click on **‘src’** -> **New** -> **Class**

After this step, a window that we name **‘Main’** is opened and we mark the box under the name **‘public static void main’**

At this point, the program has generated the assigned commands and applied them to the initial (work) page of the Eclipse program.

Note: 

**public class** = every file in Јava program is marked with ‘class’ , which means that each line of the running code should be within the ( ‘class’) class. In this case, we named the 'class' as Main
 
**public static void main (String[] args)** -> This tells the program that this is the first method that the program will execute. The program is a list of instructions that we want to execute.

In Java, each application has a starting point (input point), which is a method that is designated as 'main'. This means that each Java program starts with the main method.

**public:** anyone can access
	
**static:** Static means that the variable or method marked as such is available at the class level. The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply java static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested class. The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class.
	
**void:** The keyword void simply tells the compiler that main( ) does not return a value. *void* is the return type. It means "this method returns nothing"
	
**main:** Name of the method
