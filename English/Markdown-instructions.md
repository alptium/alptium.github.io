## Markdown instructions 

1. Use Notepad program for writing texts which you can open in  Git Hub -> alptium.github.io folder on your computer.

2. Rename the file and save it in "md.format", so it can look like this: file name.md

*Note* Usually these files and pages where you will write text are all ready made, so all you need to do is just to clone it.

3. Those who write on Serbian should use Cyrillic letter.

4. How to input pictures, bolding, inserting codes from Eclipse program etc, you can find that on the following page:


https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

5. Here i will show the picture example. First, with a Markdown I've copied the code for pictures which looks like this:
GitHub Logo

![name of the picture](/name of the folder which contain the picture/name of the picture.format)

6. Be sure that everything is written correctly, use spaces, big letters and other existing components.

7. It can happen that GItHub doesn't recognize spaces in the name of the files. This was the issue that i had with the Notepad files. It can be reconcilable if I put "-," instead of spaces.

8. When you write example codes from Eclipse, instead of screenshot, you will use this symbol ```at the beginning and at the end of the code.
This is like a quotation mark which can be found in the top left corner of the keyboard.
