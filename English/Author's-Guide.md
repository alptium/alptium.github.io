## Following changes of a text - Author's-Guide


Because of often changes of a text, which we upgrade constantly, with the aim to improve our work, for those who are translating the text, here we will write what is the best way to inform and be informed about new changes. 

Each change of a text which goes to server has its own label. 
The best way is to, within ticket (which is connected to text which has been changed), write a comment that there is a change made of the text and which label is assigned the change and send to server. 
Those labels we can see in two ways. 

First: At the server directly, within the page which is being processed:

Second: Within Git Hub Desktop application:

- Green arrow shows field **History**, where you can find the information about changes in this application.

- Red arrow shows the label.

- Blue label shows a text which has been changed, in the way that text labelled with green colour is text which is added and that text labelled with red colour is text which is added. 
The easiest way to follow where change is made, besides colour, is by the number of line of a code.

In this way we can follow changes also at the server, just mark in ticket with task (which is connected to text), in which lines text is changed or added:

## OVERVIEW OF TASKS 

We have two types of the content at the server. The first, which refers to content of weekly meetings (classes) and the second which refers to research content. Second is not within regular classes.
 Connected to that, within **Writing Project**, next **To Do** and **In progress** columns, we will have two separated **In review** columns.

Authors, who write contents of classes, switch their tickets with a task to **In review (Lesson Content)** column.

Authors, who write additional, research contents, which are not thought at regular classes, switch their tickets with a task **In review (Additional Content)**
